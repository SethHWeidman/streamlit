# TODO(armando): Automate syncing of requirements to conda/streamlit/meta.yaml
# When you update the packages here, you have to update
# conda/streamlit/meta.yaml as well.
#
# IMPORTANT: We should try very hard *not* to add dependencies to Streamlit.
# And if something is only required for testing, but not anything else, please
# add to the dev dependencies above, instead.
